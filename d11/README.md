## Git Review

- [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/): Easy syntax for styling writing. GitHub READMEs are written in this syntax.
- [PurpleBooth's README-Template](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2): A good template to help structure your project READMEs.

Task: Create a new repository on GitHub, initialize with a README, and edit the file from your machine.
