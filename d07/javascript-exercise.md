## JavaScript Loops

Work on the following exercises in Repl.it to test out your understanding of JavaScript loops.

### Sum Loop

Write code that adds up the sum of the values in the array and outputs it.

```js
let prices = [42, 21, 87, 142, 9, 51];
let sum = 0;

// Your code here

console.log("The sum is: ", sum);
```

### 99 Bottles of Juice

Write a program to output the song **99 Bottles of Juice** using a `for` loop or a `while` loop.

```shell
99 bottles of juice on the wall! 99 bottles of juice!
Take one down, pass it around...
98 bottles of juice on the wall!

98 bottles of juice on the wall! 98 bottles of juice!
Take one down, pass it around...
97 bottles of juice on the wall!

97 bottles of juice on the wall! 97 bottles of juice!
Take one down, pass it around...
96 bottles of juice on the wall!
```

Make sure it ends like so:

```shell
2 bottles of juice on the wall! 2 bottles of juice!
Take one down, pass it around... 1 bottle of juice on the wall!

1 bottle of juice on the wall! 1 bottle of juice!
Take it down, pass it around...
0 bottles of juice on the wall!
```

### Bonus:

Work with this array:

```js
[10, 15, 3, -2, 9000, -44];
```

Write code:

- Find the largest number in the array
- Find the smallest number in the array
- Create a new array that is the reverse of the above one without `.reverse()`
