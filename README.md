# Resources and Recommendations

Note: Some resources may have paid/premium options. Please utilize the free option first before considering spending any money. I haven't spent any money on the resources I've listed.

If you have any suggestions for the list, feel free to create a pull request. ;)

## Git and GitHub

- [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://help.github.com/en/articles/working-with-ssh-key-passphrases) Allows you to connect to GitHub without having to enter your account details every time
- [Git Auto-Completion](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Basics-Tips-and-Tricks#Auto-Completion) If you're using Git Bash on Windows, auto-completion is enabled by default. For Mac/Linux users, you'll have to enable it manually. **Note**: Please make sure you're comfortable using the terminal before you attempt to enable.
- [Octotree](https://github.com/ovity/octotree) A browser extension that allows you to see a code tree for any public repository on GitHub.
- [PurpleBooth's README Template](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2) Use this template as a guideline. Make your project READMEs presentable: it's the first thing people will see when they visit your profile.

## Terminal/Command Line

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) A package manager for macOS. Makes it easier to install packages such as Git, Python, Ruby, etc. on your Mac.
- [Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial/basics) A very thorough ebook on using the command line.

## Tutorials

- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) An excellent source of tutorials on various web technologies. They also have great YouTube videos and Medium articles on various topics.
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) Basic tutorials to get started with coding. I often use this as an refresher for technologies I haven't used in a while.

## Miscellaneous

- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) A social news website focused on computer science. Keep up with current technology news.
- [Reddit r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/) A forum geared towards those learning to program.

## General Advice

### Algorithms and Data Structures

Practice algorithms and data structures. Once you are done with the bootcamp, I recommend working on 2-3 problems a day. For each problem:

1. Spend 30-45 minutes on the problem. I encourage starting with pseudocode. Don't look up hints or solutions.
2. If you can solve the question, great! If not, spend some time studying the solution to the problem.
3. If you didn't solve the question, re-attempt it a week later so the solution isn't fresh in your head.

I personally use [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) but some folks prefer [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).

### Job Search

After the bootcamp, take some time off to reward yourself but don't lose your momentum! Stick to a week (or _maybe_ two) of rest.

Job searching should be treated like a full time job. A general plan to follow:

- **Monday-Thursday/Friday:** Work on algorithm/data structure problem, study technologies you want to learn or improve upon, and apply to around 5 jobs a day.
- **Weekend:** Work on portfolio projects.

Don't get discouraged if you don't hear back from companies. Just keep applying!

### Networking

[Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) is a great website to find events. Go to tech events and network with people. Don't just network vertically! Network with fellow job seekers. You never know who will think of you when they get a job and their company is looking for a referral.

### Well-Being

Don't forget to take care of your physical and mental health while coding. Some simple tips:

- Go for walks, especially when you feel stuck on a problem.
- 20-20-20 Rule: Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Resting your eyes is very important!
- Get proper sleep and stay hydrated.
- Make sure to take regular breaks while coding so you don't burn yourself out.
